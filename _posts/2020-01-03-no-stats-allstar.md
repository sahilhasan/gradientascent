> His greatness is not marked in box scores or at slam-dunk contests, but on the court Shane Battier makes his team better, often much better, and his opponents worse, often much worse.

## Summary
An article about Shane Battier, who somehow made every team he played for significantly better while never being a truly memorable name on stat sheets. It argues that even the general managers, etc of the NBA don't recognize him for what he is. Coincidentally it was Daryl Morey who speeaks often of the "moneyball"-esque potential of Shane Battier and how he made teams better. In general this is a great feel good piece about how being a fantastic team player can in some ways be as great as a superstar.
