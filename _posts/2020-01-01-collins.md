>A generally impressive set of articles about the stock market and the policies to follow for long term success. It is well worth a read and a re-read as a reminder over time.

## Summary

#### There’s a major market crash coming!!!! and Dr. Lo can’t save you
		- Dr. Lo claims that the market is faster moving and more volatile (this is probably true). Thus buy and hold is no longer effective (this is probably false)
		- JLCollins view:
            - Market crashes are to be expected. They will continue to happen
			- The market always recovers from that. The biggest thing to do is to toughen up and let it ride
			- The market always goes up. Always. Not always short term or even yearly, but it does.
			- The Market is the best performing investment class over time. Period.
			- The next 40 years will be like the past 40. Recessions and booms alike. Thus we need to toughen up and ride the storm for all of these. We will see 3 or 4 2008's and 3 or 4 mega bulls as well. Every time the financial media will say this time is different and you need to not listen.
