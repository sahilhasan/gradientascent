> A video analysis of Joe Burrow (from LSU to the Bengals), Tua Tagovailoa (from Alabama to the Dolphins), Justin Herbert (Oregon to Chargers), Jordan Love (Utah State to Packers)[^1]

## Summary
This argues that the NFL Combine has little ability to predict NFL success. Thus, the author manually goes through the film of each of the quarterbacks and collects data on a frame by frame basis. Skipping the details, which can be found in the article, it goes on to say that Joe Burrow has many of the physical traits of Joe Montana, Tua is compared "as 40-year old Drew Brees’s arm combined with 37-year-old Michael Vick’s legs," Herbert as Derek Anderson, and Love as a mini-Josh Allen.
