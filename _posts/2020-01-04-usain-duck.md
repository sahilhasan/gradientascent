An article that points out that Usain Bolt's running dominance looks incredibly suspicious when looking at doping scandals. It goes on to compare him to Lance Armstrong, and point out the effective indicators that he is likely doping. Namely, that Usain Bolt is the only one in the top 8 that has not been banned for doping.
