>This might have actually been the first guide to home-buying on the Internet, launching around 1999.  Of course, over the years I've kept it updated and added to it.  Some readers have suggested the information is so good that I should charge for it, but it's more fun for me to share it for free, knowing that I'm reaching more people. 

## Summary

A very detailed 39 page guide to all you need to know to buy house. On the level of detail of J L Collins Stock Series, but the details actually matter. Numbers and prices are out of date/not applicable to Bay Area, but his calculators are pretty robust and allow for fiddling to make decisions in ones own situation. TODO: Notes
