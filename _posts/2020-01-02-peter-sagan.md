> The 2019 Tour de France may have ended somewhat controversially, with Egan Bernal overtaking Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe on a stage stopped short by hail, but lets take a moment to appreciate Peter Sagan's dominance in the points classification of the tour [^1]

## Summary
He's won 7 of the last 8 years (missing only the 2017 Tour where he was controversially DQ'ed after "causing" a crash) and has made the competition not even close in each of the years he's won. This was last updated in 2019, but we can only hope a fantastic talent like himself continues to produce at a truly elite level.
