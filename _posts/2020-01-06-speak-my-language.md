> As the players and schemes have changed, it's the way the Patriots talk that's continued their offensive dominance

## Summary
An article that goes through the various schemes that the Patriots have used throughout their (hopefully now defunct) dominance[^1]. It explains the three major systems within the NFL: West Coast, Coryell, and Erhardt-Perkins. It gives a broad overview of each of those schemes. It then posits that no one can run a Patriots offense since many systems are too verbose, whereas the Patriots system is short and sweet.
